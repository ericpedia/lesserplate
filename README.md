lesserplate
===========
## A minimal project template with jQuery and Less

Called Lesserplate because:

1. It's a boilerplate template that includes Less.js

2. It is a much lesser creation than HTML5 Boilerplate. 

	* Less robust!
	* Less comprehensive!
	* Less (er, fewer) best practices!
	* Worsely-documented!

But I find it quick and easy to use for creating simple pages and testing out code, whether it's an HTML demo, a CSS trick, or a JS/jQuery experiment.

## Features

* Do your JS, HTML, and CSS all in one file! Inline `<style>` and `<script>` tags get a bad rap, but they sure can be convenient if you're just experimenting.
* Free jQuery and wrapper!
* Free CSS preprocessing with LESS!
* Free mixins with LESS Elements!
* Hidden from the world using robots.txt and meta tags.
* `* { box-sizing: border-box; }`

## Future

* Include jQuery and Less as submodules? Or is that overkill, if you have to [include the whole repo](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7813030/how-can-i-have-linked-dependencies-in-a-git-repo#comment9524227_7813286)?
* Remove (or replace, or fork) [Elements.less](http://lesselements.com/). There are things I don't like about Elements.less, though I like the idea of it.
* Make it better.
* Make it lesser.
