# lesserplate
===========
## A minimal project template with jQuery and Less

Called Lesserplate because

* it's a boilerplate template that includes Less.js

* it is a much lesser creation than HTML5 Boilerplate. Less rigorous, less useful, less comprehensive, barely documented. But I use it personally for the same general purpose, when dithering about with stuff I don't wish to make public.
